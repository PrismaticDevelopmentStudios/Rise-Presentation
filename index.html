    <article>
        <p>My name is Matthew Brignola. I am a 29 year old male who incurred a traumatic brain injury while downhill mountain biking at Winter Park Mountain Resort on September 2, 2019. I was initially hospitalized at Winter Park Health and then helicoptered
            to Denver Health. I was luckily responsive within the first week I was in a coma and was transferred to Craig Hospital to begin the inpatient program. I was able to be in Craig's outpatient program until the program was haulted because of
            the Covid-19 pandemic. I went to live with my mother and step father at their home in Colorado Springs and continued doing outpatient services at Penrose Outpatient Rehebilitation.</p>
        <p>Life for me has definitely not resumed to how it was before my injury, but I am making sure top take steps to help me reachieve fincancial independence.I am currently taking an online course through the University of Denver in order to recieve
            a certificate of completion so I can become a web developer. Outlined in the "Goals" page is a description of my intensions in taking this course, as well as the Humen services resources I used to pay for my scholarship.</p>
